## How to run the evaluations?
Before running the evaluations, please make sure that you have [Pypy JIT compiler](https://pypy.org/). Then,
to run the evaluations in the paper, you can simply run the following command:

```
./runEval.sh
```

This will run all evaluations in the paper one after another. Please note that
you need Pypy to run the evaluations.
